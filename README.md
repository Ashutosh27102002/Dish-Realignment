# Dish-Realignment
A dish antenna that reorients itself if disturbed from its setup orientation or should the paired satellite displaces. The setup utlises two SG90 Servo Motors to control the Elevation and the Azimuthal angle of the Dish antenna, along with a concise algorithm to autonomously provide degree of motion to the motors.
